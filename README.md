## Introduction
This repository was created as part of IBM's "Developing Front End Apps with React" course.<br>
A React application was created as a final project: Paradise Nursery Shopping Cart App.<br>
<br>
With this application, users can select plants in an online plant shop and add them to the shopping cart.<br>
